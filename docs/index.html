            <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                The purpose of this project was to develop a multi-channel, high-current motor control system.
                In many robotic applications, the ultimate deliverable power of servo motors is limited
                by built-in H-Bridge circuitry, which is typically rated for low-current operation between
                3.6-7.2V. This project's objective was to develop a substitute, closed-loop control system
				capable of supplying up to 30A/24V (0.72kW) per channel. These channels would draw power
				from a supply that is also independent of the logic circuitry.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In pursuing the objective of this project, a Raspberry Pi was fitted with an external I/O device that was capable of
            multiple PWM outputs and analog inputs. External amplification circuitry based on N-channel MOSFETs was
            designed to interface with this device in order to reproduce the PWM control signals using the external motor power
            supply. To enable bi-directional control of the motors (without the use of a multi-polarity power source), a
            relay system was configured for each channel. This switches the polarity assignment to the motor terminals
            based on the embedded controller signal. To reduce hazardous back-EMF brought about by the
            high-inductance in the switching operation, flywheel diodes were fitted across the respective inductive loads in the
            external circuit. This was particularly important in protecting the I/O hardware from back-EMF induced
            voltage spikes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The embedded system, which was programmed on the Raspberry Pi, used a myopic policy to adjust PWM-outputs
            and motor-direction signals. The control policy itself consisted of a simple exponential increase in
            PWM-output when analog feedback differed from target, saturating after a specified delta at 100%. The
            control also outputted a binary signal to switch polarity assignments when retracting the actuators.
            The Raspberry Pi communicated via serial to the external hardware I/O device in order to
            invoke these signals. The general system layout is given by (1).

            The Raspberry Pi's touchscreen interface allowed for control of 4 motors through the adjustment of on-screen
            position bars, with each motor being able to be cycled on/off by clicking the status light above its
            respective feedback display (2). A stall-out routine was also programmed to protect the user/hardware;
            this temporarily disabled the motor in the event that maximum PWM-output did not result in movement of the
            motor. This is communicated by switching the status light for the respective motor to yellow. The user may
            attempt to move the motor again by simply adjusting the position assignment, or tapping status light.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>
            The circuit diagram shown in (3) illustrates the external circuitry design that was generated to amplify the
            PWM signals, control the relay directional relays, and interface with the KL46Z. In order to amplify the PWM
            output signal from the microcontroller, high-current N-Channel MOSFETS were selected to act as amplifiers.
            When sufficient voltage is applied to the gate of a MOSFET, the doped region of the FET becomes saturated
            and allows current to flow through. In this case, it closes connection from the negative-terminal of the
            motors to ground, allowing a flow of power to the actuators from the motor power-supply.

            Each linear actuator has a stall-current rating of (15A/30A) for a (12V/24V) power supply, respectively. [4]
            Thus, given a maximum design selection of 24V, each MOSFET must be capable of handling at least 30A of
            current. The selected MOSFETs (4) are capable of handling up to 60V and 30A of continuous load. [2]

            The gate voltage required to turn on/off (close the connection) of this MOSFET is 3-5V, with 10mA of
            required gate current. This is within range of the outputs of the KL46Z microcontroller. Thus, this
            selection satisfies the motor-drive criteria, and is shown in the circuit as Motor Drivers A through D.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important aspect to consider with this design, however, is the back-EMF that will inevitably be
            experienced by the circuit as a result of inductance. This was a set-back encountered during the design and
            testing process, which was rippling back through the circuit and invoking a reset of the connected
            microcontroller. Back-EMF is produced when there is significant change in the current flow a system with
            high-inductance, which creates a voltage-spike that can damage MOSFET circuitry. Thus, flywheel diodes are
            to be added across both the MOSFET, and the DC motors, such that these voltage spikes may be rectified
            harmlessly when invoked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given this system is not being designed with multi-polarity power supply and bidirectional control of the DC
            motors is required, an additional switching circuit is required in order to swap the port connections to the
            motors when necessary. This may be performed using a single-pole, double throw (SPDT) relay for each port,
            as given by (5).

            Two of these devices will be required per actuator in order to swap both motor ports between the ground
            and positive input signals. Relay pairs will share the same control signal and swap simultaneously. In the
            event of a relay failure, the polarity will simply be the same on both ports, and as such, no hazard is
            presented. However, the required pick-up ratings for the input control signal is 5V, 185mA. [3] Given two
            of these will be driven by the same control signal, this exceeds the rating of the microcontroller output.
            Thus, the relays drive signal will need to be powered by using an additional MOSFET circuit, which will act
            as the relay-driver (as shown in the electrical schematic).
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure that the amplification circuitry met the required switching speeds, the circuit was configured and
            tested at a maximum reasonable PWM-frequency of 1kHz while connected to an external DC motor. The results
            are shown in (6).

            The circuitry displayed no significant propagation delays and matched the frequency with satisfactory
            precision. Thus, the full circuit was built and fully-configured to interface with all four motors, as shown

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
            The overall architecture of the system consists of two primary threads for execution: The GUI thread
            and the motor control thread. This allows the motor control and the GUI to operate independently of one
            another, and to meet their performance requirements without interfering with the parallel processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI system is an extension of our previous works. A UI framework had previously been written based on
            PyGame. This implements a core rendering loop with composable and extendable UI elements, and an interface to
            update the framework for these elements. We have primitives for labels, buttons, modal buttons (swap between
            states), sliders, progress bars, sprites, status pips (coloured circular buttons), and elements
            which are composed of other elements. These expose an update (refresh internal state), render (draw on
            screen), and handle click/drag (update slider position) methods. They build upon a debouncer
            primitive and our core entity framework, which is a superclass that provides default implementations for
            each of these methods (reducing boilerplate for elements which dont need every method). The run-loop
            handles setting up the program for operations on the pi (setting the display output, mouse drivers, etc), as
            well as handling events, refreshing elements, and redrawing the UI elements. This section is fairly straight
            forward, and more specific details on this can be found in previous ECE 5725 labs.

        </p>
        <p>
            The shared states between the motor controller and the UI are the data models, AnalogIn, DigitalOut, PWMOut,
            and Actuators. These are container classes that store the data used for the UI state and the motors, which use
            python properties to transform the data from (for example) the 0.3-3.0v range of the analog inputs into the
            0-1 range of the progress bar. This allows for a natural programming model, where repetitive transformations
            are transparently performed to the data, and the scope is reduced for bugs resulting from a failure to 
            transform inputs correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the motor-controller and the UI hold references to these models and updates them as needed, with the
            motor controller calling a refresh on these models once a cycle (avoiding the overhead of redundant
            communication with the microcontroller for every operation). Each model then sends a request along the
            serial channel and awaits a response (if needed), either updating the stored data on the microcontroller, or
            updating its internal view of the state of the microcontroller. The serial channel is implemented using the
            PySerial library running a 57.6kbps baudrate connection. It uses a request-response model, where it sends a
            request and expects a response (empty string or a numeric value) rather than a fully asynchronous approach.
            This is reasonable given the updating is deferred to a separate thread and doesnt block the main GUI thread.

                Figure 9: Motor Control Speed Curve
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Calibrating the motor control curves (acceleration and speed) proved to be a fairly complicated problem, as
            the initial approach of bounding speed to the square of the distance of the motor from its intended position
            gave a very undesirabe, slow acceleration curve and top-end speed. Many iterations were attempted, and we
            finally settled on the above curve, which reaches maximum speed fairly quickly but still offers gradual
            startup and shutdown to avoid overshoot.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the software side, there were several interesting challenges faced by this project. One of the first was
            managing performance in the core loop. Due to limitations on the microcontroller side, we were bandwidth
            constrained on the serial link between the host (Raspberry Pi) and the microcontroller. Many issues
            stemmed from this problem. The first that was encountered during the initial design came from the numerous
            reads and writes to the I/O device that were synchronously performed in the core rendering loop. Since there 
            could be multiple reads to a single pin per cycle, this significantly affected performance during the software
            loop, causing refresh rates to drops in PyGame down to single digit FPS, which was unacceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was no magic bullet solution to this problem. The first step that had been taken was increasing
            the baudrate of the system from 9600bps to 57.6kbps, which did significantly improve performance in terms of
            motor control refresh rate. However, this still left the GUI rendering loop far below an acceptable standards. 
            Consequently, the control signals were moved over to refreshing in an asynchronous model, with a second thread 
            running in the background and periodically refreshing the model objects on the client side and the microcontroller 
            (as described above). This fully decoupled the motor control logic from the GUI refresh logic, allowing both to
            perform far more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            After these issues were solved, another issue that was discovered was with the serial system. Around 0.1% of 
            requests to the micro-controller were corrupted. Eventually, this was tracked down to being caused by the 8 byte
            serial receive buffer on the micro-controller overflowing and dropping characters. The solution was to move from a
            fully custom serial command parser to the micro-controllers streaming serial command parser, which is
            included as part of its standard library. This provided all of the required functionalities, with the benefit
            of being far better tested than the bespoke command parser. This new parser has been completely reliable for
            our use case.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were also issues which werent related the serial channel, namely due to near abandon-ware status of
            PyGame. Pygame has not been properly ported to python 3, and exhibited a series of extremely strange issues when
            operating under load. This was resolved by backporting the system to python 2, rewriting the code as needed.
            Code quality was lost, but the tradeoff in stability which justified the decision. The final issue was a mysterious 
            and inexplicable hard crash of the operating system when running the system directly on the Raspberry Pi. This
            was eventually tracked down to having being caused by the usage of the RT kernel, and was solved by
            reverting to the standard kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Validation involved testing each software component individually. First, the GUI as it was written, followed
            by the motor control system as it was implemented. Each of the UI elements used were manually tested as well. The 
            system was given commands in a stochastic fashion, and its resulting actions/outputs were observed and validated. 
            The system was then gradually tested with stand-in components for the real hardware, until finally being tested as 
            a fully integrated, monolithic unit. All performanc parameters were achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, solving these issues has led to a more robust and stable design. We are pleased with our
            resulting system.

            The closed-loop controller was successfully developed by creating an embedded operating system on the
            Raspberry Pi, which effectively manipulated the control outputs via serial communication using the external
            hardware I/O device (KL46Z). Adjustments made to the motor position assignment, via the user-interface, were
            successfully represented by the PWM and control signal outputs based on the current position. When power was
            removed from a motor, the stall routine successfully detected the motors lack of responsivity and cut
            PWM-output. All user-functionality was tested and performed as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The external amplification circuit design exceeded the desired power specifications by 6V, and a
            corresponding 180W, while meeting electric-current specifications. The circuit effectively powered all 4
            motors, simultaneously, at the maximum load that was allowable given Cornells lab power-supply equipment.
            Components handled aggressive directional switching and stress tests without failure. The negative effects
            of back-EMF were also nullified through the appropriation of flywheel diodes. Stress-testing of the motors
            via manual resistance to actuator position changed was futile in negatively affecting any dynamic
            characteristics, and all position changes on the piTFT were successfully achieved under every test
            conditions.

            Consequently, the system performed as intended and all outlined objectives were met.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            The results of this project met all outlined objectives, yielding the successful development of an embedded
            software/hardware device capable of closed-loop control of high-load DC motors. The power supply for the DC
            motors may range anywhere between 3.6V-30V, and the load-demand of the DC motors can range up to 30A per
            channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this project, we discovered that the use of high-inductance devices under switching applications
            yields hazardous back-EMF to connected hardware, and can disable and/or damage connected I/O ports.
            Consequently, the use of diodes was well-implemented in order to drain this excess voltage and protect
            peripheral components.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many issues were encountered throughout the implementation of the software, and solutions or workarounds were
            developed for each of them in turn. In general, the serial link is one factor which still has room for
            improvement, but overall, solving these issues has led to a more robust and stable design. We are pleased
            with our resulting system.

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Given additional time, we would likely explore the closed-loop control of DC motors that were not
            implemented actuators (which require very little control finesse). Instead, we would attempt to control
            gearbox-based DC motors, which represent additional challenges in optimizing control output to avoid
            overshoot and instability. However, given the intended use of this circuitry (for actuator-based
            applications), the current system yields satisfactory performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would also like to move more of the control loop to the microcontroller, although the python is
            reasonable for a prototype better performance could be achieved.

                My contributions to this project were primarily in the system-level design, assembly, and testing. To
                begin the project, I discussed with my partner the software/hardware capabilities we required to be
                successful and ensured we were both clear in our forward paths. My initial efforts were focused on
                designing an end-to-end system that was capable of meeting the desired functionality specifications
                given by our project description, all while being within budget constraints ($100). During this time, I
                also worked with my partner in selecting a suitable hardware I/O device, one which offered the
                sufficient functionality while remaining compatible with the RasPi. Once we had selected the appropriate
                hardware and electrical components, it was my responsibility to order, configure, and test my
                amplification-circuit design for functionality. When feedback issues were encountered in the external
                circuit, I researched the cause and remedied the problem through additional design work. Upon success, I
                built the rest of the circuit and integrated the full system with our DC motors and hardware I/O system.
                At this point, I worked with my partner and his software-development efforts to ensure an appropriate
                control-scheme was achieved for the motors and that end-to-end functionality was feasible. From this
                point on, work was entirely cooperative from both parties in debugging the hardware/software in order to
                achieve a fully-operational end product.

                Responsible for designing, implementing and testing the software for the system. We implemented the
                control loop in conjunction with one another and I took responsibility for handling the UI,
                microcontroller work and overall software architecture. Testing of the software system in isolation was
                primarily my task and we cooperatively tested the integrated system, adjusting and implementing new
                functionality as needed.
